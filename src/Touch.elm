{-| Early stages of gesture recognition for touch-events.

This is intended to be used in qualified form.


# Hooking it up

In your model:

    { gesture : Touch.Gesture }

In your init:

    { gesture = Touch.blanco }

In your Msg:

    type Msg
        = Swipe Touch.Event
        | SwipeEnd Touch.Event

In your view:

    Html.div
        [ Touch.onStart Swipe
        , Touch.onMove Swipe
        , Touch.onEnd SwipeEnd
        ]
        [ Html.text "Swipe me!" ]

In your update:

    Swipe touch ->
        { model | gesture = Touch.record touch model.gesture }

    SwipeEnd touch ->
        let
            gesture : Touch.Gesture
            gesture =
                Touch.record touch model.gesture

            -- use inspection functions like `isTap` and `isLeftSwipe`
        in
        { model | gesture = Touch.blanco }

**Note**: This sets `preventDefault = True` to avoid double events from occuring
when the same DOM node also has an `onClick` attribute. Using `preventDefault`
means that if a `touchend` event happens, the `onClick` handler won't fire.

If you have a case where you need to support a regular `onClick` event nested in
a node that has `onEnd` on it (for example; a container with swipe support,
which contains a button from an external package), please see `onEndWithOptions`.
